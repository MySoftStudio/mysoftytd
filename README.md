## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

I created MySoft YTD back in 2017 when I was 14 years old. I just got started with programming and I had so much fun working on the project. It took me like a month to work and release it in November 2017.
It is currently available on PayHip of course for FREE since November 2017. https://payhip.com/b/0GwM.

## ‚ú® Purpose & Future

I decided to open source this project for history purpose. I want to remember how I coded back in that time. If I have time I might rewrite everything in C#.
